### Hello Coders 🐛! 

Welcome to my blog, in this space you will find notes, tutorials, and guides on topics that have helped me develop as a programmer. Learning is something that I am passionate about and marvel at, that's why I will be sharing my learnings and experiences on this blog.

I hope that what you find on this blog is helpful or marvels you as much as it does for me. Do not hesitate to write to me if you have any comments, questions, suggestions, or gossip 🤙🏼
