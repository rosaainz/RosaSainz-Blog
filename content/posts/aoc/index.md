## Intro
Advent of Code is a series of problems that are presented to the public every year during the month of December. Here's more information: [adventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/) ðŸŽ„  

## Repo
This post is dedicated to y experience with the solutions of 2015 using python, but in this [repository](https://github.com/rosaainz/adventOfCode_mySolutions) ðŸ“•, you will find my solutions for this and other years.

## Experience
I remember the day I solved my first AoC (Advent of Code) puzzle. I was at a cafe â˜•, and my mentor asked me to tackle an AoC exercise using the programming language I was most comfortable with. I felt nervous ðŸ˜« because I didn't consider myself proficient in any particular language at the time. While I had some knowledge of C, Java, and Python, it was limited to the fundamentals. I hadn't even read the problem statement, and I was already doubting my ability to solve it due to my perceived lack of language expertise.

Nevertheless, I decided to stay calm and chose Python because it was the language I had been recently studying. To alleviate the stress related to the programming language itself, I focused on finding a solution. I read and re-read the problem statement multiple times as I struggled to see the right path to a solution. I grabbed a notebook and started sketching my ideas. It was during this process that I finally grasped how to approach coding the solution.

Transitioning my thoughts to actual code proved to be a bit challenging, as my knowledge of the language was limited. I wanted to attribute my struggles to my lack of experience, but in the end, I managed to earn my first star ðŸŒŸ

As a beginner, that first star was a significant milestone for me. However, I soon realized that I had to tackle a second part of the code to earn another star and unlock the first problem. This pattern continued with each new challenge, and the difficulty level increased gradually. With each program I completed, I gained valuable knowledge and skills, making the learning experience both challenging and rewarding ðŸ§ 

## Recommendations
One valuable tip I'd like to share is the importance of thoroughly reading the problem statement. This has proven to be incredibly helpful for me. Additionally, having a notebook ðŸ“• on hand to sketch out and design your solution can be a game-changer. It not only helps you visualize your approach but also serves as a handy reference throughout the problem-solving process.

Lastly, never give up and don't hesitate to seek out a wealth of information and assistance. Advent of Code challenges can be complex, and there's a vast amount of resources available, including online tutorials, forums, and communities, where you can find help and guidance when needed. Persistence and a willingness to learn are key to mastering these puzzles.
