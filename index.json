My name is Rosa Sainz, and I am delighted to share my passion for technology, my learning experiences, and my learning journey with you. To be honest, technology didn\u0026rsquo;t always captivate me. During my childhood, I had limited exposure to electronic devices. However, my innate curiosity and fascination with finding solutions and making improvements have always driven me.\nI am genuinely excited about delving into the world of software engineering. The ability to enhance or transform systems, solving problems through a combination of creativity, design, and programming, resonates deeply with me. It empowers me to bring innovative ideas to life and make a meaningful impact.\nWhile my passion lies in technology, I am also an avid learner across various disciplines like dance and drawing, which allows me to explore and express my creativity in different forms.\nThank you for joining me on this exciting personal development.\nHow I got here # My interest in technology started when I was studying electrical engineering at UAM Azcapotzalco. Originally, I wanted to focus on renewable energy. But then, I got more interested in computing and decided that I wanted to learn about it, even though I had some doubts.\nAt first, I thought people studying computer science were really smart and had been coding for a long time. I was afraid that if I changed my career, I would struggle to catch up. However, I took a leap of faith and trusted in myself, thanks in part to a teacher who encouraged me and taught me about logical design, Linux, and C programming.\nSoon after, the pandemic hit, and the way I was learning became challenging. Communication with my teachers wasn\u0026rsquo;t great, and I often had to study on my own. So, I started looking for online resources to help me learn. That\u0026rsquo;s when I found MakingDevs, where I\u0026rsquo;m currently training as a software engineer.\nIt hasn\u0026rsquo;t been easy, but I\u0026rsquo;m determined to overcome any obstacles. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to continue learning and growing in the field of software engineering. Technology has opened up new opportunities for me, and I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for that. I\u0026rsquo;m pushing myself to become a skilled professional in the ever-changing world of technology. ü´∞üèº\n","date":"May 16, 2023","permalink":"/RosaSainz-Blog/about/","section":"Rosa Sainz","summary":"Who am I? # Hi!
