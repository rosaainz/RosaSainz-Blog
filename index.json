Define keywords to identify the start of an order if certain words are mentioned in the message, for example, \u0026ldquo;order,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I want this,\u0026rdquo; etc. Connect to WhatsApp using an API. Identify the order using the keywords. Once the message is obtained, identify the quantity and name of the product. This can be done by dividing the order into rows, then into words, and lemmatizing to unify the words. For example, if someone writes \u0026ldquo;conchitas,\u0026rdquo; it should be treated as \u0026ldquo;conchas.\u0026rdquo; Then, store the quantity with the corresponding product, possibly in a map. Validate that those words exist in the catalog. Retrieve the price from the catalog, multiply it by the quantity, and sum up each result to obtain the total. Generate a message with the quotation and send it via WhatsApp to the same number from which the message was received. Problems # I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how to start coding, so I began by doing lemmatization exercises. Essentially, I asked Chat GPT to provide me with exercises to understand lemmatization. I did a couple of exercises, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t fully grasp how lemmatization worked.\nI started by creating a simple code. I created a text file that contains products with their prices, and the code takes an order with the products listed exactly as they are in the catalog. It calculates the total amount by multiplying the quantity of requested items by the price and summing up those multiplications. This code worked only if the input was written in a specific format.\nSolutions # I was interested in lemmatization because I wanted to be able to receive messages in any format and have the program continue calculating the total. I was struggling with the lemmatization part because I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand it well. That\u0026rsquo;s when I reached out to my mentor, José Juan, and that\u0026rsquo;s when everything clicked, haha! He told me to try typing myers.diff(\u0026quot;hola\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ola\u0026quot;) in the Python REPL and analyze the output.\nAs you can see, the letters that remain are labeled with a \u0026lsquo;k\u0026rsquo;. Here\u0026rsquo;s more information: https://pypi.org/project/myers/\nSo, in my code, I implemented a comparison between each product in the message and each product in the catalog. I counted the occurrences of the letter \u0026lsquo;k\u0026rsquo;, and if it was above the average, then that product from the catalog would be used to calculate the total.\nRepo # Anyway, I will be sharing the entire process through the repository: https://github.com/rosaainz/order_whatsapp\n","date":"31 May 2023","permalink":"/RosaSainz-Blog/projects/order_whats/","section":"Projects","summary":"Intro # The project involves receiving an order via WhatsApp for a product and the system sending a message back with the quotation for the order.\nInputs # Examples of the input:","title":"Order_whats"},{"content":"","date":"31 May 2023","permalink":"/RosaSainz-Blog/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects"},{"content":"","date":"16 May 2023","permalink":"/RosaSainz-Blog/tags/aoc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"aoc"},{"content":"","date":"16 May 2023","permalink":"/RosaSainz-Blog/categories/practice/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"practice"},{"content":" Intro # Advent of Code is a series of problems that are presented to the public every year during the month of December. Here\u0026rsquo;s more information: adventOfCode 🎄\nRepo # This post is dedicated to y experience with the solutions of 2015 using python, but in this repository 📕, you will find my solutions for this and other years.\nExperience # I remember the day I solved my first AoC (Advent of Code) puzzle. I was at a cafe ☕, and my mentor asked me to tackle an AoC exercise using the programming language I was most comfortable with. I felt nervous 😫 because I didn\u0026rsquo;t consider myself proficient in any particular language at the time. While I had some knowledge of C, Java, and Python, it was limited to the fundamentals. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t even read the problem statement, and I was already doubting my ability to solve it due to my perceived lack of language expertise.\nNevertheless, I decided to stay calm and chose Python because it was the language I had been recently studying. To alleviate the stress related to the programming language itself, I focused on finding a solution. I read and re-read the problem statement multiple times as I struggled to see the right path to a solution. I grabbed a notebook and started sketching my ideas. It was during this process that I finally grasped how to approach coding the solution.\nTransitioning my thoughts to actual code proved to be a bit challenging, as my knowledge of the language was limited. I wanted to attribute my struggles to my lack of experience, but in the end, I managed to earn my first star 🌟\nAs a beginner, that first star was a significant milestone for me. However, I soon realized that I had to tackle a second part of the code to earn another star and unlock the first problem. This pattern continued with each new challenge, and the difficulty level increased gradually. With each program I completed, I gained valuable knowledge and skills, making the learning experience both challenging and rewarding 🧠\nRecommendations # One valuable tip I\u0026rsquo;d like to share is the importance of thoroughly reading the problem statement. This has proven to be incredibly helpful for me. Additionally, having a notebook 📕 on hand to sketch out and design your solution can be a game-changer. It not only helps you visualize your approach but also serves as a handy reference throughout the problem-solving process.\nLastly, never give up and don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to seek out a wealth of information and assistance. Advent of Code challenges can be complex, and there\u0026rsquo;s a vast amount of resources available, including online tutorials, forums, and communities, where you can find help and guidance when needed. Persistence and a willingness to learn are key to mastering these puzzles.\n","date":"16 May 2023","permalink":"/RosaSainz-Blog/posts/aoc/","section":"Posts","summary":"Intro # Advent of Code is a series of problems that are presented to the public every year during the month of December.

My name is Rosa Sainz, and I am delighted to share my passion for technology, my learning experiences, and my learning journey with you. To be honest, technology didn\u0026rsquo;t always captivate me. During my childhood, I had limited exposure to electronic devices. However, my innate curiosity and fascination with finding solutions and making improvements have always driven me.\nI am genuinely excited about delving into the world of software engineering. The ability to enhance or transform systems, solving problems through a combination of creativity, design, and programming, resonates deeply with me. It empowers me to bring innovative ideas to life and make a meaningful impact.\nWhile my passion lies in technology, I am also an avid learner across various disciplines like dance and drawing, which allows me to explore and express my creativity in different forms.\nThank you for joining me on this exciting personal development.\nHow I got here # My interest in technology started when I was studying electrical engineering at UAM Azcapotzalco. Originally, I wanted to focus on renewable energy. But then, I got more interested in computing and decided that I wanted to learn about it, even though I had some doubts.\nAt first, I thought people studying computer science were really smart and had been coding for a long time. I was afraid that if I changed my career, I would struggle to catch up. However, I took a leap of faith and trusted in myself, thanks in part to a teacher who encouraged me and taught me about logical design, Linux, and C programming.\nSoon after, the pandemic hit, and the way I was learning became challenging. Communication with my teachers wasn\u0026rsquo;t great, and I often had to study on my own. So, I started looking for online resources to help me learn. That\u0026rsquo;s when I found MakingDevs, where I\u0026rsquo;m currently training as a software engineer.\nIt hasn\u0026rsquo;t been easy, but I\u0026rsquo;m determined to overcome any obstacles. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to continue learning and growing in the field of software engineering. Technology has opened up new opportunities for me, and I\u0026rsquo;m grateful for that. I\u0026rsquo;m pushing myself to become a skilled professional in the ever-changing world of technology. 🫰🏼\n","date":"16 May 2023","permalink":"/RosaSainz-Blog/about/","section":"Rosa Sainz","summary":"Who am I? # Hi!
